**Plot 1: Pie chart of Types of Nobel Prize given**

![Nobel Prize Pie Chart](Nobel%20Prize%20Pie%20Chart.png)

We plotted the distribution of the fields in which the Nobel Prizes were handed out. To no one's surprise, they are almost all the same
except for the economics prize which was started much later than the rest.

**Plot 2: Comparison of British Pound and Bahraini Dinar against USD over time**

![Exchange rate Plot](https://github.com/matthshiel/Visualizing-Datasets/blob/main/Bahraini%20Dinar%20and%20British%20Pound%20vs%20USD%20Chart.png)

here we compared two different currencies over time to the USD. Something that may stand out is the the Bahraini Dinar's rate compared
to the dollar has remained constant. This is not a mistake, I just learned through this plot that the Dinar is pegged to the US dollar.
